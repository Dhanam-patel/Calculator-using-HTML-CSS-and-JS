# Calculator-using-HTML-CSS-and-JS
As I continue my journey of learning JavaScript, I am excited to share one of my key projects: a fully functional calculator. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it represents a significant milestone in my development as a front-end programmer. The calculator was designed to handle a wide range of basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with smooth and accurate functionality.<br><br>

The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and how it can be integrated with HTML and CSS to create dynamic, interactive web applications. By working on this calculator, I was able to explore key JavaScript concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and the logic behind mathematical operations.<br><br>

In terms of design, I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface using CSS, ensuring that the calculator is not only functional but also visually appealing. The layout is responsive, meaning that it adapts well to different screen sizes, making it accessible across various devices. This project also gave me valuable experience in debugging, refining logic, and optimizing code for performance.<br><br>

Overall, this calculator serves as a practical example of my progress in JavaScript, and it marks a step forward in my journey to becoming a skilled developer. Itâ€™s a reflection of both my current skill set and my dedication to continually improving as I explore more advanced topics in JavaScript and web development.<br><br>
